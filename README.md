# Taper

(n.) The thinning ending of a stroke ([fontshop](https://www.fontshop.com/glossary#taper))

Taper is a quick and dirty way of rendering a type hierarchy in the browser. It's a great way to find pairings that work well together in a browser.

## Setup

* Clone the repo
* `npm install`
* `gulp`

## Usage

![Taper example](https://raw.github.com/wearefriday/taper/master/screencast.gif)

Open up <http://localhost:3000> in your favourite browser and you will see some example text and a list of available styles. Click on the sample text on the left (or the HTML block) to edit. Click on sample text and then select a style from the right. Your changes are stored in the browser in case you hit refresh.

## Changing type styles

The style rules are derived from `_typography.scss`. For more on this technique see [Taming typography using Sass maps](http://nick-dunn.co.uk/blog/taming-typography-using-sass-maps/).
